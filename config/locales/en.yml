    para_1: We are an independent, non-partisan group of translators and software developers.
    para_2: We share a belief that by harnessing the voices of moderation from citizens around the world frustrated by the lack of progress in resolving the conflict, we can both inspire and pressure governments to do the right thing.
    para_3_html: We hope that having read the %{petition_link} and the %{faq_link}, you will want to %{sign_petition_link} and make your voice heard. Thank you.

  faq:
    number_01:
      question_html: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has existed for generations. Why launch a petition now?
      answer_html: Moderate voices in the conflict are increasingly drowned out by extremist views and actions, and both sides seem far from making compromises. We want this non-partisan petition to counter this. The number of <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/" target="_blank">internet users world wide</a> is rapidly increasing, and this provides us with the opportunity for an online petition to build momentum for change.
    number_02:
      question_html: Can I sign the petition more than once?
      answer_html: We ask that you sign the petition only once so the signature count represents unique individuals. We would love for you to share the petition with your friends and family though.
    number_03:
      question_html: Will you publish any signature data?
      answer_html: We will only publish country and place/city data. We will never share email addresses or names.
    number_04:
      question_html: Will you send me unwanted emails?
      answer_html: No, absolutely not. Once we have sent you an email to confirm your signature, no further emails will be sent.
    number_05:
      question_html: How do I know the signature counts are accurate?
