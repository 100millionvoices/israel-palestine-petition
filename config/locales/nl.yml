    para_3_html: We hope that having read the %{petition_link} and the %{faq_link}, you will want to %{sign_petition_link} and make your voice heard. Thank you.

  faq:
    number_01:
      question_html: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has existed for generations. Why launch a petition now?
      answer_html: Moderate voices in the conflict are increasingly drowned out by extremist views and actions, and both sides seem far from making compromises. We want this non-partisan petition to counter this. The number of <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/" target="_blank">internet users world wide</a> is rapidly increasing, and this provides us with the opportunity for an online petition to build momentum for change.
    number_02:
      question_html: Can I sign the petition more than once?
      answer_html: We ask that you sign the petition only once so the signature count represents unique individuals. We would love for you to share the petition with your friends and family though.
    number_03:
      question_html: Will you publish any signature data?
      answer_html: We will only publish country and place/city data. We will never share email addresses or names.
