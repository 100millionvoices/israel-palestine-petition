* You will need ruby 2.3
* You will need PostgreSQL

## How to run the test suite

We use rspec so to run tests use the command:

`bin/rspec`

## GeoIP location

We are using geoip data from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/. The data file location is set in `.env.development`.

## Thanks

We have borrowed shamelessly from https://github.com/alphagov/e-petitions. Thank you to @alphagov, @ubxd and all the gem authors. Your work is much appreciated.
